# Time To Planet

Changes the planet text on the Argo screen to include the travel time.

Not sure if there is enough time to land on a planet when on route to a flashpoint with a tight deadline?  Unsure if round trip travel to a planet will take 4 days or 14 days?  Then this mod is for you.

# Compatibility 
Safe to add and remove from existing saves.

The mod only changes the UI and not the functionallity.  
It should be compatible with all mods.  The exception would be any mod that changes the planet text on the Argo screen.

# Travel to Planet Time Bug

On the "to do" list.

The issue below is not caused by the mod and will not impact the use.

Need to verify this.  There appears to be two different times for landing on a planet:

* At the end of a navigation path = "Jump distance" days, which can up to about 11 days.
* Aborting a navigation in progress = 3 days.

The effect is that the navigation abort time will be correctly reflected by this mod, but the end of navigation time will not.  However, since the end of navigation automatically departs to the planet, the mod usage is not an issue.
